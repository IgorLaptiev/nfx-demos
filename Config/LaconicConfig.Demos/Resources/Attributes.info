{\rtf1\ansi One of the main purpose of any configuration file is to fill class istances with values stored in it. With *.laconf configuration you can do it by placing \b NFX.Environment.ConfigureAttribute \b0 on class members and then call \b ConfigAttribute.Apply() \b0 to automatically supply your class members with config values. You can also implement \b NFX.Environment.IConfigurable \b0 interface to achieve more precise control over filling class from configuration node.}
