{\rtf1\ansi While working with configurations you can merge two of them into one with \b NFX.Environment.Configuration.CreateFromMerge() \b0 method. It creates a new configuration from ordered merge result of two other nodes which can be from different configurations. The first argument is a "base" node that data is defaulted from. And the second one contains overrides/additions of/to data from base node. Also you can influence on merging process with \b _override \b0 pragma.}
