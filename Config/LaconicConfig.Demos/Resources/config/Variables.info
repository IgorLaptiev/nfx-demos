{\rtf1\ansi In your configurations you can use "variables" which can take values of configuration tree nodes. To get the value of some node construction \b $(<path_to_the_node>) \b0 is used (for more details about paths see "Navigation" tab). Besides that you can work with environment variables (\b ~<name_of_variable>\b0 ) and you can even make your own variables resolver. Also to expand the functionality of variables using macro inserts (\b ::<macro_name>\b0 ) can be added.}
