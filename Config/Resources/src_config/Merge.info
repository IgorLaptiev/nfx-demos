{\rtf1 While working with configurations you can merge two of them into one with {\b NFX.Environment.Configuration.CreateFromMerge()} method. It creates a new configuration from ordered merge result of two other nodes which can be from different configurations. The first argument is a "base" node that data is defaulted from. And the second one contains overrides/additions of/to data from base node. Also you can influence merging process with {\b _override} pragma.}
