{\rtf1 You can create special type of configuration {\b NFX.Environment.CommandArgsConfiguration} based on arguments supplied from command line which is {\b string[]}. Arguments start with either "/" or "-" prefix. If any argument is not prefixed then it is written as an auto-named ({\b ?index}) attribute node of the root with its value set, otherwise a section (under root) with argument's name is created. Any argument may have options. Any option may either consist of name or name value pair delimited by "=". Argument options are written as attribute nodes of their corresponding sections. If option value specified without name (without "=") then option is auto-named.}
