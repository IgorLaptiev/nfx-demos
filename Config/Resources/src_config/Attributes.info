{\rtf1 One of the main purpose of any configuration file is to fill class istances with values stored in it. With *.laconf configuration you can do it by placing {\b NFX.Environment.ConfigureAttribute} on class members and then call {\b ConfigAttribute.Apply()} to automatically supply your class members with config values. You can also implement {\b NFX.Environment.IConfigurable} interface to achieve more precise control over filling class from configuration node.}
