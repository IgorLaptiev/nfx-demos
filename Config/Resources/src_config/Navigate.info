{\rtf1 To get an access to some node in your configuration tree you can use two ways.\line
  1. Using DOM. This way can be used in application only and supposes the using of next methods of {\b NFX.Environment.ConfigNode}:\line
indexer {\b [subsection_name]} - for access to subsection,\line
{\b AttrByName(name_of_attribute)}  or {\b AttrByIndex(index_of_attribute)} - for access to attribute.\line
  2. Paths. This way can be use directly in the configuration. Use:\line
{\b /} - as leading char for root,\line
{\b ..} - for step up,\line
{\b $} - for attribute name,\line
{\b [int]} - for access to subsection or attribute by index,\line
{\b section[value]} - for access using value comparison of named section,\line
{\b section[attr=value]} - for access using value of sections named {\i attr}.\line
Multiple paths may be coalesced using {\b |} or {\b ;}. If path starts from {\b !}  then exception will be thrown if such
node does not exist. In application you can use {\b NFX.Environment.ConfigNode.Navigate(path)}  which navigates 
the {\i path} and return the appropriate node.\line
To return path from the root to the node {\b NFX.Environment.ConfigNode.RootPath()} is used.}
