{\rtf1 In your configurations you can use variables which can take values of configuration tree nodes. To get the value of some node construction {\b $(path_to_the_node)} is used (for more details about paths see "Navigation" section). Besides that you can work with environment variables ({\b ~name_of_variable}) and you can even make your own variables resolver. Also to expand the functionality of variables using macro inserts ({\b ::macro_name}) can be added.}
